# Youtube Music Tauri App

Just a simple Youtube Music Tauri app to not have to launch a heavy Web browser for it :^)

## Why ?

[This Electron app]() already exists, I know. But I find it stupidly heavy for what it is supposed to do. The only thing I want from an app like this is to consume less resources it would than on a regular browser, and it is not the case for Electron.
